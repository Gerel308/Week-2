          History
        </h2>

        <p style="margin-right: 20px; margin-left: 20px">
          Impressionism, a broad term used to describe the work produced in the
          late 19th century, especially between about 1867 and 1886, by a group
          of artists who shared a set of related approaches and techniques. The
          founding Impressionist artists included Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste
          Renoir, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Edgar Degas, and Berthe
          Morisot. Other significant Impressionists, including Gustave
          Caillebotte, Mary Cassatt, Paul Gauguin, and Georges Seurat, joined
          the group later. Although these artists had stylistic differences,
          they had a shared interest in accurately and objectively recording
          contemporary life and the transient effects of light and color. These
          concerns may seem fairly banal in the 21st century, but in the 19th
          century—when historical, biblical, and allegorical subjects were
          favored, and painting was expected to have a high finish—they were
          revolutionary. The Impressionists helped liberate art from a focus on
          subject toward personal expression and the study of creating.
